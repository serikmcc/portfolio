                    <h2>About Erik McCoy</h2>

                    <p class="lead">I have been in the Web &amp; Software world for 8+ years, and have enjoyed every minute of it. From leaving with a degree when I first began this journey, to building my knowledge and skillset over time with trial and error, I truly enjoy every facet that this career field offers.</p>

                    <p class="lead">I mainly work within the PHP language, harnessing both the pure code itself and the many frameworks it has built around it, and leverage the front-end power of jQuery / JavaScript to deliver functional, beautiful, and working projects that fit the clients needs to the maximum. From simple informational sites for college students, to completely custom E-Commerce platforms that have all the bells and whistles, you are hard-pressed to find me saying, "No..." on any project I take on.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-3">I have continued to build my knowledge of a myriad of other languages along the way, and have truly enjoyed the opportunites they have opened for me. A cleaner list of the languages / technologies I am familiar with:</p>

                    <ul class="mb-3">
                        <li>PHP Frameworks: CodeIgniter, CakePHP, Laravel</li>
                        <li>MySQL / SQLite</li>
                        <li>REST API / API development</li>
                        <li>jQuery / JavaScript</li>
                        <li>React.js</li>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>C# -- minimal and within the Unity engine</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="lead">I truly love the landscape this world creates for me, and all of the ups &amp; downs that come with it. No matter the challenge, I absolutely sink myself into creating exactly what the client wants, and deliver crisp, clean websites and applications to all at affordable pricing.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Look no further to get the website or application up and running! <a href="#contact">Reach Out</a> today and let's get to talkin' about your next project or website that you are looking to launch!</p>

In any case, I have worked on small projects to MASSIVE projects, mostly done from a "Lone-Wolf" standpoint, but have also worked on small &amp; large teams within the development world. I have also progressed into the Game Development world, and have worked on a few titles with a current release on Steam!</p>

                                    <p class="mb-3">I have also created a whole landscape of plugins for Minecraft servers which are housed on the SpigotMC network. All of these plugins are free and available for their prospective versions of Minecraft and bring some pretty nifty features to your Minecraft gameplay. Some of them were community requested plugins, but a great majority of them were born from my own ideas while playing the game itself.</p>
